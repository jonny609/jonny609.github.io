# Languages

Here are the languages I know:
- English: I have a C1 level of english and I have been learning it since I was a kid
- French: I do not have an oficial level of frenc but I learned it in school and I know the minimum to have a conversation
- Spanish: My native language
- Polish: I would like to learn it but it is really difficult and in the time I have been in Poland for Erasmus I just learned the basic things
