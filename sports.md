# Sports

Here are the different sports I have practiced:
 - Karate: I practiced it for 9 years and I got the brown belt but when I was 14 I stopped practicing it
 - Soccer: I never practiced it in a club but I played a lot in school and I still go to play with my friends on weekends
 - Tennis: I practiced it for 5 years but I stopped because I have a problem with my shoulder that prevents me from playing.
 - Swimming: I practiced it when I was in school but I did not liked it so I never practiced it again
