# Hobbies

Here are some of my hobbies:

- Soccer: I like playing soccer and watching it with my friends
- Watching Films: I love watching films and my favourite ones are about war
- Playing videogames: I usually play video games to disconnect from everything, and my favorite is FIFA, which is a soccer game
- Tennis: I also like tennis, some years ago I used to train and play games but now I just watch it on TV
- Travelling: I love travelling around the world and the last two years I have visited a lot of countries around Europe and I have also been in Morocco and Dominican Republic
